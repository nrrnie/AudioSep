# AudioSep
Install python packages
Note: librosa requires Python version < 3.11, so use 3.10 instead

```py pip install -r requirements.txt``` 
or
```py -m pip install -r requirements```

# The Idea
Basically a CLI program that separates audio sources (usually music). The intended usage is to activate the program through the terminal: ```./working.py --file='track.mp3' --duration=30 --target=vocals? etc.```

# TO DO:
